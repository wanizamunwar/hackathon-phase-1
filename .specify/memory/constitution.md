# Evolution of Todo - Phase I (Python Console App) Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
All development must strictly adhere to Spec-Driven Development. Specifications (Constitution, Spec, Plan, Tasks) must be written and approved before implementation. Claude Code will generate the implementation; manual coding is prohibited.

### II. Pythonic Design
All code, especially for the Python console app, must follow Python's idiomatic conventions (PEP 8) and best practices. Code must be clean, readable, and well-documented.

### III. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
TDD is mandatory. Tests must be written and approved (RED), then implementation follows to make tests pass (GREEN), followed by refactoring. This cycle is strictly enforced for all features.

### IV. Console-First Interface
For Phase I, the application must provide a clear and functional command-line interface. Input and output should be text-based, user-friendly, and interactive where appropriate for a console application.

### V. In-Memory Data Management
All task data for Phase I must be managed entirely in-memory. No persistent storage (files, databases) is allowed. This simplifies development for the initial phase.

### VI. Modularity and Simplicity
The codebase must be designed with modularity in mind, separating concerns (e.g., data logic, UI logic). Prioritize simple solutions; avoid over-engineering.

## Development Constraints

*   **Technology Stack**: Python for the console application.
*   **Code Generation**: All implementation code must be generated by Claude Code via Spec-Kit Plus. Manual code writing is forbidden.
*   **Data Persistence**: Phase I explicitly requires in-memory data storage only. No external databases or file systems for data storage.
*   **GitHub Command Restriction**: GitHub-related commands (e.g., git push, gh pr create) must not be executed until explicitly instructed at the end of the project.

## Quality Gates

*   **Automated Testing**: All features must have corresponding unit tests.
*   **Code Review**: All generated code will be reviewed against the specified principles and Pythonic standards.
*   **Functional Verification**: The console application must demonstrate all specified basic-level Todo features through user interaction.

## Governance
This Constitution governs all development activities for the "Evolution of Todo" project.
Amendments require review and approval by the project lead.
All PRs and code changes must demonstrate compliance with the principles outlined herein.
Changes to the Constitution will follow semantic versioning.
